I'm Florian, 28yo, passionate about software engineering and living in Geneva, Switzerland, from where I can enjoy a beautiful lake :-)

Before that, I graduated from a French engineering university in 2012, Epitech.

This blog is going to be a way for me to share my passions especially programming. Most of the content will probably be about Ruby/Rails and Go.

You can contact me via email(see on the homepage), or follow me on Twitter, Linkedin or Github.

And if you're in Geneva, and want to grab a coffee sometime, don't hesitate!
